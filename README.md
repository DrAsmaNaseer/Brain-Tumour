The focus of this project is on early diagnosis of brain tumor via Convolution Neural Network (CNN) to enhance state-of-the-art diagnosis accuracy. The proposed CNN is trained on a benchmark dataset, BR35H, containing brain tumor MRIs. The performance and sustainability of the model is evaluated on six different datasets, i.e., BMI-I, BTI, BMI-II, BTS, BMI-III, and BD-BT.
